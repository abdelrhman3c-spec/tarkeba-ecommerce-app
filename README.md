## Description

Tarkeba is an e-commerce application designed for selling perfumes. Built with the [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework, it leverages TypeScript for a robust and scalable architecture. The application includes features such as user authentication, product management, order processing, and email notifications. It integrates with Google OAuth for user authentication and uses Redis for caching and session management. The backend is powered by MongoDB, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

Key Features:
- User registration and login with email verification
- Google OAuth integration for authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Role-based access control
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Order processing and management
- Email notifications for account verification and password reset
- Redis integration for caching and session management
- JWT-based authentication and refresh tokens
- Comprehensive unit and e2e testing

This project is a comprehensive solution for building a modern e-commerce platform with a focus on security, scalability, and maintainability.
